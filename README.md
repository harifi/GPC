Giza Pyramids Construction: an ancient-inspired metaheuristic algorithm for optimization

This code presents a new population-based metaheuristic algorithm inspired by a new source of inspiration. This algorithm is called **Giza Pyramids Construction (GPC)** inspired by the ancient past able to deal with many issues. The ancient-inspired is to observe and reflect on the legacy of the ancient past to understand the optimal methods, technologies, and strategies of that era. The GPC algorithm is controlled by the movements of the workers and pushing the stone blocks on the ramp. The ancient past is the new ideology and origin of inspiration that introduced by this paper for the first time. In the ancient past there were numerous limitations, but various man-made structures show that the limitations and the lack of hardware and software facilities have given rise to some sort of optimization in ancient times.
